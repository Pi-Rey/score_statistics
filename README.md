# Grade Calculator Program

## Overview

This C++ program calculates grades based on credits entered for various subjects. It provides functionalities to input credits, convert credits to grades, display grades, and show statistics.

## Features

- **Input Credits:** Users can enter credits for each of the five subjects: Mathematics, Swedish, English, History, and Physics. Credits must be between 0 and 100. If an invalid value is entered, the program prompts the user to retry.

- **Convert Credits to Grades:** Once credits are entered, the program converts them to letter grades ('A' to 'F') based on predefined grade ranges.

- **Display Grades:** After conversion, the program displays each subject along with its corresponding grade.

- **Statistics:** The program calculates and displays statistics such as the number of 'A', 'C', and 'F' grades, and the total sum of credits entered.

## How to Use

1. **Compile and Run:** Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++). Run the compiled executable.

2. **Input Credits:** Follow the prompts to enter credits for each subject. Ensure credits are within the valid range (0-100).

3. **View Grades:** Once all credits are entered, the program will display the corresponding grades for each subject.

4. **Check Statistics:** After displaying grades, the program will show statistics including the number of each grade category and the total sum of credits.
